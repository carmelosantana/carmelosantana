    A passionate developer who’s grateful for all things open-source.

## Hello World!

Open-source software has played a pivotal role in my life. Providing this self-taught developer with countless opportunities to grow both personally and professionally. In an effort to give back I’m creating new open-source projects while contributing to those I care about whenever possible. This presents a unique opportunity for my children to get a glimpse of what has driven my career and digital direction all these years.
